# Click
A commentary on the senseless nature of shifting bits around, and an unveiling of the miniscule magnitude of your digital actions

Have you ever found yourself in Kraxophony? 
Well, maybe, but you wouldn't know because I invented that term.
Kraxophony that is the internal emotional state of having many available avenues to do things that are good for you or could make you happy, but not feeling like pursuing any particular one. Instead, one rests in a sort of dissatisified in-between state, unable to start or do anything.
Well, when I am in Kraxophony, I often end up browsing the web. My mind likes to make up a reason that I am doing something essential and a lot of time is often wasted away until I notice that I have only been clicking on banners because they are beautiful.
Ultimately, this is my contribution into the world of productivity apps:
Click.
